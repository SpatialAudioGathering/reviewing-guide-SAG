# A Guide to Paper Reviewing for SAG

## The most important question

Reviews are an essential part of the feedback to SAG authors. The central, guiding question for all reviews is this: 

**Does this submission present a unique, important, and useful enhancement to spatial audio and spatialisation field of research?** 

## Writing a SAG review

### Read the submission

It seems self-explanatory, but it’s important to read the submission, in its entirety. Some useful questions to ask yourself while you read:

- What’s the central idea in this paper? Is it clear?  
- What’s the contribution that this paper makes?  
- Is the contribution unique? (This doesn’t mean it’s never been written about before, but rather that there’s something here that is singular \- that could be an implementation, a technical aspect, an evaluation technique, a theoretical perspective, an artistic take, etc)  
- Does the contribution add value to the field's body of knowledge?

### Write the review

Reviews are an important way to offer the author feedback on their work \- telling them what was positive, what could use improvement, and how you see this work as contributing to community knowledge.

These are the goals of reviewing:

1. To point out the strengths of the submission  
2. To identify possible weaknesses of the submission  
3. To offer feedback on what would improve the submission  
4. To offer a perspective on whether the submission makes a valid, meaningful contribution to SAG.

#### 1: Summarise the paper.

Writing a few sentences summarising the paper is a great way to start. It demonstrates to the author that you read and considered the paper, and is a good jumping-off point for your own thoughts.

#### 2: Summarise the positives.

Every paper, no matter how lacking, has positive aspects \- maybe it’s well written, or it provides an excellent bibliography, or contains great documentation or illustrations. 

#### 3: Summarise the negatives, and suggest ways that these might be improved.

Summarise any negative aspects, and suggest ways that these might be improved. It’s important to remember that authors are doing their best!

#### 4: State your rating, and give a justification.

Finally, state your recommendation (Strong Accept, Accept, Weak Accept, Borderline, Weak Reject, Reject or Strong Reject). Clearly state why you are making this recommendation. Please take a moment to contextualise this rating within the question that guides our decisions for SAG content: ***Does this submission present a unique, important, and useful enhancement to the field's body of knowledge? Why or why not?***

### Review FAQs

#### How long should a review be?

There’s no minimum or maximum length for reviews, but reviews have a recommended structure: It should summarise the paper’s topic and main points, state the positive and negative aspects, and offer a recommendation for acceptance with a well-articulated reasoning for that recommendation. 

Typically, this is 150-300 words. However, you are free to use as much space as you think is necessary.

#### If the paper is great, do I need to submit a detailed review?

Yes\! Authors depend on feedback, and explaining why you thought something was great is as important as a less positive critique.

Just as importantly, your review is important to the meta-reviewer, who will be making a final recommendation. They are keenly interested in your feedback and perspective, and this helps them make acceptance decisions that include a wide range of perspectives.

#### What happens if the paper content is interesting, but the writing isn’t good?

We ask that reviewers focus on the *content* of the paper. Meta-reviewers will make the call about whether the writing is a factor.

#### What makes a paper unreviewable?

Papers are rejected at the beginning of the process (known as a “desk reject”) for the following reasons:

- The authors names are included (ie, the paper is not anonymised)  
- The paper is not submitted in English  
- The paper is obviously not complete (ie, section headings but no content)  

These are the only situations in which there can be a desk rejection. Otherwise, the paper goes to review.

#### What happens if I don’t submit a review?

Since SAG is dependent on reviews to select the proceedings, we ask you to please submit your reviews if you have committed to reviewing for this year’s SAG.

If for some reason reviewing is impossible, please tell your meta-reviewer as soon as possible so another reviewer can  be found.
