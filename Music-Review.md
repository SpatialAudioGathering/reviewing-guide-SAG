# A Guide to Music Track Reviewing for SAG

This contains the most important information for you as a reviewer, including what questions to consider or what to include in a review.

## Writing a SAG music track review

Reviews are an essential part of feedback to submitters. The central, guiding question for all reviews is this: **Does this submission present an original, important, inspiring and useful enhancement to the community knowledge?**

With this question in mind, here’s a guide to writing a SAG review.

## Perusing the submitted media documentation

Please carefully watch and listen to the submitted/linked media examples.

## Reading the submission document

It seems self-explanatory, but it’s important to read the submission PDF accompanying the media examples, in its entirety. Some works require contextualization to be properly evaluated, and the document is expected to explain the concept and thoughts behind the work, the technologies used, and its connection to spatial audio research. It should also describe the technical setup.

Some useful questions to ask yourself:

- What’s the central idea of the work? Is it clear?
- What is the artistic quality of the work? Artistic quality is of course a very complex concept, but you may consider aspects such as concept, implementation, authenticity, novelty, virtuosity, originality, craft, effort, legacy, relevance, and engagement.

## Writing the review

Reviews are an important way to offer the author feedback on their work - telling them what was positive, what could use improvement, and how you see this work as contributing to community knowledge.

These are the goals when reviewing music and installation submissions:

1. To point out the strengths of the submission
2. To identify possible weaknesses of the submission
3. To offer feedback on what would improve the submission
4. To offer a perspective on whether the submission makes a valid, meaningful contribution to the artistic program of SAG.
5. To give an indication of the atmosphere and requirements for the piece or art-installation.
  a. A description of a location in which the submission will thrive.
  b. An indication of the need of other special technical requirements.

### 1: Summarise the work.

Writing a few sentences summarising the work is a great way to start. It demonstrates to the author that you have perused the submitted media and read the submission description document and formed an adequate view of the work.

### 2: Summarise the positives.

Every work, no matter how lacking, has positive aspects. 

### 3: Summarise the negatives, and suggest ways that these might be improved.

Summarise any negative aspects, and suggest ways that these might be improved for the future.

### 4: State your rating, and give a justification.

Finally, state your recommendation (Strong Accept, Accept, Weak Accept, Borderline, Weak Reject, Reject, Strong Reject). Clearly state why you are making this recommendation.

## Some FAQs on reviewing

### What should I do if I feel completely unqualified to assess this submission?

Though we try to match the specialisation of reviewers to the submissions, you might get a review related to a genre, style or technology that you are not familiar with, or do not feel comfortable evaluating.

Here good reviews are essential! A summary of the submission, what you understand from it as someone without expertise in this area, and what you see as strengths and weaknesses that can be useful and provide important feedback to the submitter.

If you are really not comfortable reviewing it, please contact the music chairs.

### How long should a review be?

There’s no minimum or maximum length for reviews, but reviews have a recommended structure: It should describe the submission’s main concepts, state the positive and negative aspects in relation to the criteria listed above, and offer a recommendation for acceptance with a well-articulated reasoning for that recommendation.

For the Art track, this can range from 100 to 250 words.

### If the composition/performance/installation is great, do I need to submit a detailed review?

Yes! Submitters depend on feedback, and explaining why you thought something was great is as important as a less positive critique.

Just as importantly, your review is important to the music chairs, who will be making a final recommendation. They are keenly interested in your feedback and perspective, and this helps them make acceptance decisions that include a wide range of perspectives.

### What happens if the media/video is interesting, but the quality of documentation isn’t good?

We ask that reviewers focus on the_content_of theperformance/installation. Music-chairs will make the call about whether the documentation is a factor- though please highlight your findings.

### What makes a composition/performance/installation unreviewable?

Submissions are rejected at the beginning of the process (known as a “desk reject”) for the following reasons:

- The submission is not submitted in English
- The submission is obviously not complete (e.g. no expected media or documentation) or do not follow the template provided.

These are the only situations in which there can be a desk rejection. Otherwise, the submission goes to review. Such decisions are taken by the music chairs, but they will be grateful for your help in identifying any potential problems.

### What happens if I don’t submit a review?

Since SAG is dependent on reviews to select the proceedings, we ask you to please submit your reviews if you have committed to reviewing for this year’s SAG. 

If for some reason reviewing is impossible, please tell the chairs as soon as possible so another reviewer can be found.
